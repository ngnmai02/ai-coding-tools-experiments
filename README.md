This repository consists of 2 small experiments to test out 3 differents AI-powered coding assistant tools: Cursor, Windsurf and Cline.

### Experiment 1
- Given: a README.md as context.
- Request: Generate the ML project based on given README.md and respond to other refactoring or editing request.
- To observe: 
    - Time to generate the whole project codebase.
    - Time to refactor or edit code given multi commands.
    - Different system prompts' effect on the code output and agent's working style.

### Experiment 2
