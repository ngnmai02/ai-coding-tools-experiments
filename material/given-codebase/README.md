# Given code repository used for testing speed and quality of agentic chat bot

## Main idea of the repository
Saliency detection by using pyramid feature attention network. The network separating features from VGG16 into 2 different pipelines: low features from early layers and high features in later layers. Spatial attention was used for low features and Context-aware Pyramid Feature Extraction was used for high features. Combined result of the whole pipeline will provide saliency map of the image.
